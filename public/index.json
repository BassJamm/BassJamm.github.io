Don\u0026rsquo;t forget about setting a BIOS password, it is easy to forget this step until it is to late in the process. Include SSPR in the remit of your Intune project, it saves so much time. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget LAPS. Setup 3 dynamic groups in Entra ID to do the following. 1st on to capture all Intune Devices. 2nd one to capture all Intune Users. 3rd one to capture all Autopilot Devices. Create a dynamic group to capture all devices by targetting a device category, this is useful to have config and apps apply after Autopilot. Create a Conditional Access policy, that will only allow access if the deivces is policy compliant, make sure this is applied to the all intune users dynamic group. Extend the compliancy to longer than in production to aid in testing and longer deployment times. Check your Configuration Profile settings do not conflict with the Security Baseline policies. I have expanded on some below.\nDynamic Groups I have suggestd 4 groups in the above list, below are the reasons for them and the dynamic query suggestions.\nConfiguring groups as Dynamic Device groups automates the process of adding devices to the appropriate group, reducing administrative overhead. Check out this Microsoft documentation for reference.\nTo create a group that includes all of your Autopilot devices, enter: (device.devicePhysicalIDs -any (_ -contains \u0026quot;[ZTDID]\u0026quot;)), the [ZTDID] field identifies Zero-Touch Deployment IDs for your devices. To create a group that includes all Autopilot devices with a specific group tag (the Azure AD device OrderID), enter: (device.devicePhysicalIds -any (_ -eq \u0026quot;[OrderID]:179887111881\u0026quot;)), the OrderID refers to the Azure AD device\u0026rsquo;s Order ID. To create a group that includes all your Autopilot devices with a specific Purchase Order ID, enter: (device.devicePhysicalIds -any (_ -eq \u0026quot;[PurchaseOrderId]:76222342342\u0026quot;)). To create a group that collects devices based on their category, try, (device.deviceCategory -eq \u0026quot;IT\u0026quot;). This group will only find devices after the user selects the category in the Company Portal or an Admin assigns the machine on from Intune. Apply patching, Apps or config you want to apply after Autopilot has done it\u0026rsquo;s bit. BIOS Password Painfully, this often has to be done manually by someone who is provisioning the machine however, some brands do offer command line tools to do this. Lenovo is one example of this and Dell also offer this via their Dell Software.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll update this same post as I find more, hope it helps someone!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/december2024/autopilotsetupsuggestions/","summary":"Some quick fire suggestions for setting up Autopilot","title":"AutoPilot Setup Suggestions"},{"content":"Creating the Uninstall package Note that the download link to the McAfee Consumer Product Removal Tool will download the latest version.

Key challenges include:\nBuilt-in Reporting Limited features often fall short of customer needs, requiring custom PowerShell scripts. Retention Periods: Difficult to audit, making it hard to track data outside of the backup retention window. SharePoint Script Issues: Pre-version 8, Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s security settings frequently disabled script execution. Group Ownership Gaps: Groups without owners aren\u0026rsquo;t backed up unless manually addressed. Backup Speed: Microsoft throttling significantly slows job completion times. Easy to lose control: We had various people\\teams look after this product, configuration drift has really left it in a mess in places. Below, I\u0026rsquo;m sharing what I have found, used and troubleshooted.\nTroubleshooting Scripts Checking the Last Backed up Time for an Object The notes below are for Item-Level Backups, which is based on the last modified date of the items within the backups (Emails, Files, Groups etc). Snapshot level backup retention works the same way accept you lose the whole snapshot not just the items.\nAn object is any one of the following item, User, Group, Site, Team, Organization, OneDrive, Mailbox. The script below helps identify when the object was last successfully backed up. Unfortunately, it does not identify which item in the backup is falling out of scope of the retention but, does give an idea of when items will start being removed from the backup job.\nFor example, in a SharePoint site, the file \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t Delete Me\u0026rdquo;, was last modified on the 1st of September 2021. If the retention is 3 years, the document would have been removed from the backups 4 months ago, but, other data in that site may have been edited in 2024 and so is still in scope of the retention.\nI went a bit mad on the Write-Host commands in this script but, the staff who\u0026rsquo;d be running this are not all savvy with Powershell so thought more information was better.\nReviewing the VBO Logs You can download the logs using the Veeam Console.\nOpen the Console. Click the Hamburger Menu in the top left. Select Help and Support. Select Support Information. With Collect Logs selected, Click next. Select the proxy server your job is running via. Save the logs to a good location and extract them. The script below doesn\u0026rsquo;t perform many complex actions; it simply removes some square brackets and creates separate date and time variables in their own columns. However, it simplifies the process, making it easier to continue searching, formatting, and exporting the logs from PowerShell.\nSome of the logs can be over 100,000 lines so there is a progress bar written into the foreach loop for some visual feedback.\nParsing Job Warnings and Errors It\u0026rsquo;s quite useful to be able to pull out any warnings or errors from the previous jobs. Below is a script that can help do that.\nThe starttime is optional, if you do not provide it, it will provide the most recent job matching the name you provide. Make sure to enter the starttime as a string like the example shows.\nRemoving a User\u0026rsquo;s License This process can be a bit of a pig, there is a Veeam Blog or KB post here.\nBest Practices Guide If you are looking for what Veeam suggest about how to setup and use this solution, there\u0026rsquo;s a guide here for version 7.\nJET Database Errors This will not be an issue once upgraded to version 8 as they have swapped over to Postgresql instead of JET.\nError Example Example error, 21/03/2024 20:28:39 :: Failed to process site: https://domain.sharepoint.com/sites/sitename.

Deleted all cache files except the database, allowing Veeam to recreate them. Attempted another repair. Finally, we deleted the cache database and performed a re-sync. Since our database was only 80GB, this was completed within hours. They did warn me that this proess could take days if the .adb file is larger.\nI quote Veeam here, JET errors are notoriously hard to fix without a cache re-sync. They’re typically caused by a forcefully terminated open thread to the database, such as a server reboot.\nWarning: Possible team chat sync problem was detected An odd issue quickly fixed by Veeam Support: a mailbox tied to a Microsoft 365 group refused to back up, running for days without completing.\nVeeam advised against terminating jobs that are running outside the job Window and to allow atleast 2 retries for a job to minimise issues with throttling and JET based errors, see here for JET Errors.\nLog File snippet you should find 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [05.08.2024 05:24:55.909] 68 (8380) Changed items: 0, deleted items: 0, read state changes: 100 [05.08.2024 05:24:55.909] 68 (8380) Warning: Possible team chat sync problem was detected [05.08.2024 05:24:55.914] 47 (5180) Processing mailbox: groupmailboxup@groups.domain.com...

Key challenges include:\nBuilt-in Reporting Limited features often fall short of customer needs, requiring custom PowerShell scripts. Retention Periods: Difficult to audit, making it hard to track data outside of the backup retention window. SharePoint Script Issues: Pre-version 8, Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s security settings frequently disabled script execution. Group Ownership Gaps: Groups without owners aren\u0026rsquo;t backed up unless manually addressed. Backup Speed: Microsoft throttling significantly slows job completion times. Easy to lose control: We had various people\\teams look after this product, configuration drift has really left it in a mess in places. Below, I\u0026rsquo;m sharing what I have found, used and troubleshooted.\nTroubleshooting Scripts Checking the Last Backed up Time for an Object The notes below are for Item-Level Backups, which is based on the last modified date of the items within the backups (Emails, Files, Groups etc). Snapshot level backup retention works the same way accept you lose the whole snapshot not just the items.\nAn object is any one of the following item, User, Group, Site, Team, Organization, OneDrive, Mailbox. The script below helps identify when the object was last successfully backed up. Unfortunately, it does not identify which item in the backup is falling out of scope of the retention but, does give an idea of when items will start being removed from the backup job.\nFor example, in a SharePoint site, the file \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t Delete Me\u0026rdquo;, was last modified on the 1st of September 2021. If the retention is 3 years, the document would have been removed from the backups 4 months ago, but, other data in that site may have been edited in 2024 and so is still in scope of the retention.\nI went a bit mad on the Write-Host commands in this script but, the staff who\u0026rsquo;d be running this are not all savvy with Powershell so thought more information was better.\nReviewing the VBO Logs You can download the logs using the Veeam Console.\nOpen the Console. Click the Hamburger Menu in the top left. Select Help and Support. Select Support Information. With Collect Logs selected, Click next. Select the proxy server your job is running via. Save the logs to a good location and extract them. The script below doesn\u0026rsquo;t perform many complex actions; it simply removes some square brackets and creates separate date and time variables in their own columns. However, it simplifies the process, making it easier to continue searching, formatting, and exporting the logs from PowerShell.\nSome of the logs can be over 100,000 lines so there is a progress bar written into the foreach loop for some visual feedback.\nParsing Job Warnings and Errors It\u0026rsquo;s quite useful to be able to pull out any warnings or errors from the previous jobs. Below is a script that can help do that.\nThe starttime is optional, if you do not provide it, it will provide the most recent job matching the name you provide. Make sure to enter the starttime as a string like the example shows.\nRemoving a User\u0026rsquo;s License This process can be a bit of a pig, there is a Veeam Blog or KB post here.\nBest Practices Guide If you are looking for what Veeam suggest about how to setup and use this solution, there\u0026rsquo;s a guide here for version 7.\nJET Database Errors This will not be an issue once upgraded to version 8 as they have swapped over to Postgresql instead of JET.\nError Example Example error, 21/03/2024 20:28:39 :: Failed to process site: https://domain.sharepoint.com/sites/sitename. Unable to access repository (E:\\*VBOCacheName*\\PersistentCache\\repository.adb) JetError -1504, JET_errNullInvalid, Null not valid :: 0:03:27.\nSolution Raise a ticket with Veeam first—they’ll guide you in using eseutil.exe (a Microsoft tool for troubleshooting Exchange databases) to check database integrity.\nSteps we followed:\nRan an integrity check and repair. Deleted all cache files except the database, allowing Veeam to recreate them. Attempted another repair. Finally, we deleted the cache database and performed a re-sync. Since our database was only 80GB, this was completed within hours. They did warn me that this proess could take days if the .adb file is larger.\nI quote Veeam here, JET errors are notoriously hard to fix without a cache re-sync. They’re typically caused by a forcefully terminated open thread to the database, such as a server reboot.\nWarning: Possible team chat sync problem was detected An odd issue quickly fixed by Veeam Support: a mailbox tied to a Microsoft 365 group refused to back up, running for days without completing.\nVeeam advised against terminating jobs that are running outside the job Window and to allow atleast 2 retries for a job to minimise issues with throttling and JET based errors, see here for JET Errors.\nLog File snippet you should find 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [05.08.2024 05:24:55.909] 68 (8380) Changed items: 0, deleted items: 0, read state changes: 100 [05.08.2024 05:24:55.909] 68 (8380) Warning: Possible team chat sync problem was detected [05.08.2024 05:24:55.914] 47 (5180) Processing mailbox: groupmailboxup@groups.domain.com...

SharePoint Script Issues: Pre-version 8, Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s security settings frequently disabled script execution. Group Ownership Gaps: Groups without owners aren\u0026rsquo;t backed up unless manually addressed. Backup Speed: Microsoft throttling significantly slows job completion times. Easy to lose control: We had various people\\teams look after this product, configuration drift has really left it in a mess in places. Below, I\u0026rsquo;m sharing what I have found, used and troubleshooted.\nTroubleshooting Scripts Checking the Last Backed up Time for an Object The notes below are for Item-Level Backups, which is based on the last modified date of the items within the backups (Emails, Files, Groups etc). Snapshot level backup retention works the same way accept you lose the whole snapshot not just the items.\nAn object is any one of the following item, User, Group, Site, Team, Organization, OneDrive, Mailbox. The script below helps identify when the object was last successfully backed up. Unfortunately, it does not identify which item in the backup is falling out of scope of the retention but, does give an idea of when items will start being removed from the backup job.\nFor example, in a SharePoint site, the file \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t Delete Me\u0026rdquo;, was last modified on the 1st of September 2021. If the retention is 3 years, the document would have been removed from the backups 4 months ago, but, other data in that site may have been edited in 2024 and so is still in scope of the retention.\nI went a bit mad on the Write-Host commands in this script but, the staff who\u0026rsquo;d be running this are not all savvy with Powershell so thought more information was better.\nReviewing the VBO Logs You can download the logs using the Veeam Console.\nOpen the Console. Click the Hamburger Menu in the top left. Select Help and Support. Select Support Information. With Collect Logs selected, Click next. Select the proxy server your job is running via. Save the logs to a good location and extract them. The script below doesn\u0026rsquo;t perform many complex actions; it simply removes some square brackets and creates separate date and time variables in their own columns. However, it simplifies the process, making it easier to continue searching, formatting, and exporting the logs from PowerShell.\nSome of the logs can be over 100,000 lines so there is a progress bar written into the foreach loop for some visual feedback.\nParsing Job Warnings and Errors It\u0026rsquo;s quite useful to be able to pull out any warnings or errors from the previous jobs. Below is a script that can help do that.\nThe starttime is optional, if you do not provide it, it will provide the most recent job matching the name you provide. Make sure to enter the starttime as a string like the example shows.\nRemoving a User\u0026rsquo;s License This process can be a bit of a pig, there is a Veeam Blog or KB post here.\nBest Practices Guide If you are looking for what Veeam suggest about how to setup and use this solution, there\u0026rsquo;s a guide here for version 7.\nJET Database Errors This will not be an issue once upgraded to version 8 as they have swapped over to Postgresql instead of JET.\nError Example Example error, 21/03/2024 20:28:39 :: Failed to process site: https://domain.sharepoint.com/sites/sitename.

Don\u0026rsquo;t forget about setting a BIOS password, it is easy to forget this step until it is to late in the process. Include SSPR in the remit of your Intune project, it saves so much time. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget LAPS. Setup 3 dynamic groups in Entra ID to do the following. 1st on to capture all Intune Devices. 2nd one to capture all Intune Users. 3rd one to capture all Autopilot Devices. Create a dynamic group to capture all devices by targetting a device category, this is useful to have config and apps apply after Autopilot. Create a Conditional Access policy, that will only allow access if the deivces is policy compliant, make sure this is applied to the all intune users dynamic group. Extend the compliancy to longer than in production to aid in testing and longer deployment times. Check your Configuration Profile settings do not conflict with the Security Baseline policies. I have expanded on some below.\nDynamic Groups I have suggestd 4 groups in the above list, below are the reasons for them and the dynamic query suggestions.\nConfiguring groups as Dynamic Device groups automates the process of adding devices to the appropriate group, reducing administrative overhead. Check out this Microsoft documentation for reference.\nTo create a group that includes all of your Autopilot devices, enter: (device.devicePhysicalIDs -any (_ -contains \u0026quot;[ZTDID]\u0026quot;)), the [ZTDID] field identifies Zero-Touch Deployment IDs for your devices. To create a group that includes all Autopilot devices with a specific group tag (the Azure AD device OrderID), enter: (device.devicePhysicalIds -any (_ -eq \u0026quot;[OrderID]:179887111881\u0026quot;)), the OrderID refers to the Azure AD device\u0026rsquo;s Order ID. To create a group that includes all your Autopilot devices with a specific Purchase Order ID, enter: (device.devicePhysicalIds -any (_ -eq \u0026quot;[PurchaseOrderId]:76222342342\u0026quot;)). To create a group that collects devices based on their category, try, (device.deviceCategory -eq \u0026quot;IT\u0026quot;). This group will only find devices after the user selects the category in the Company Portal or an Admin assigns the machine on from Intune. Apply patching, Apps or config you want to apply after Autopilot has done it\u0026rsquo;s bit. BIOS Password Painfully, this often has to be done manually by someone who is provisioning the machine however, some brands do offer command line tools to do this. Lenovo is one example of this and Dell also offer this via their Dell Software.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll update this same post as I find more, hope it helps someone!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/december2024/autopilotsetupsuggestions/","summary":"Some quick fire suggestions for setting up Autopilot","title":"AutoPilot Setup Suggestions"},{"content":"Creating the Uninstall package Note that the download link to the McAfee Consumer Product Removal Tool will download the latest version.

Don\u0026rsquo;t forget about setting a BIOS password, it is easy to forget this step until it is to late in the process. Include SSPR in the remit of your Intune project, it saves so much time. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget LAPS. Setup 3 dynamic groups in Entra ID to do the following. 1st on to capture all Intune Devices. 2nd one to capture all Intune Users. 3rd one to capture all Autopilot Devices. Create a dynamic group to capture all devices by targetting a device category, this is useful to have config and apps apply after Autopilot. Create a Conditional Access policy, that will only allow access if the deivces is policy compliant, make sure this is applied to the all intune users dynamic group. Extend the compliancy to longer than in production to aid in testing and longer deployment times. Check your Configuration Profile settings do not conflict with the Security Baseline policies. I have expanded on some below.\nDynamic Groups I have suggestd 4 groups in the above list, below are the reasons for them and the dynamic query suggestions.\nConfiguring groups as Dynamic Device groups automates the process of adding devices to the appropriate group, reducing administrative overhead. Check out this Microsoft documentation for reference.\nTo create a group that includes all of your Autopilot devices, enter: (device.devicePhysicalIDs -any (_ -contains \u0026quot;[ZTDID]\u0026quot;)), the [ZTDID] field identifies Zero-Touch Deployment IDs for your devices. To create a group that includes all Autopilot devices with a specific group tag (the Azure AD device OrderID), enter: (device.devicePhysicalIds -any (_ -eq \u0026quot;[OrderID]:179887111881\u0026quot;)), the OrderID refers to the Azure AD device\u0026rsquo;s Order ID. To create a group that includes all your Autopilot devices with a specific Purchase Order ID, enter: (device.devicePhysicalIds -any (_ -eq \u0026quot;[PurchaseOrderId]:76222342342\u0026quot;)). To create a group that collects devices based on their category, try, (device.deviceCategory -eq \u0026quot;IT\u0026quot;). This group will only find devices after the user selects the category in the Company Portal or an Admin assigns the machine on from Intune. Apply patching, Apps or config you want to apply after Autopilot has done it\u0026rsquo;s bit. BIOS Password Painfully, this often has to be done manually by someone who is provisioning the machine however, some brands do offer command line tools to do this. Lenovo is one example of this and Dell also offer this via their Dell Software.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll update this same post as I find more, hope it helps someone!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/december2024/autopilotsetupsuggestions/","summary":"Some quick fire suggestions for setting up Autopilot","title":"AutoPilot Setup Suggestions"},{"content":"Creating the Uninstall package Note that the download link to the McAfee Consumer Product Removal Tool will download the latest version.

Key challenges include:\nBuilt-in Reporting Limited features often fall short of customer needs, requiring custom PowerShell scripts. Retention Periods: Difficult to audit, making it hard to track data outside of the backup retention window. SharePoint Script Issues: Pre-version 8, Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s security settings frequently disabled script execution. Group Ownership Gaps: Groups without owners aren\u0026rsquo;t backed up unless manually addressed. Backup Speed: Microsoft throttling significantly slows job completion times. Easy to lose control: We had various people\\teams look after this product, configuration drift has really left it in a mess in places. Below, I\u0026rsquo;m sharing what I have found, used and troubleshooted.\nTroubleshooting Scripts Checking the Last Backed up Time for an Object The notes below are for Item-Level Backups, which is based on the last modified date of the items within the backups (Emails, Files, Groups etc). Snapshot level backup retention works the same way accept you lose the whole snapshot not just the items.\nAn object is any one of the following item, User, Group, Site, Team, Organization, OneDrive, Mailbox. The script below helps identify when the object was last successfully backed up. Unfortunately, it does not identify which item in the backup is falling out of scope of the retention but, does give an idea of when items will start being removed from the backup job.\nFor example, in a SharePoint site, the file \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t Delete Me\u0026rdquo;, was last modified on the 1st of September 2021. If the retention is 3 years, the document would have been removed from the backups 4 months ago, but, other data in that site may have been edited in 2024 and so is still in scope of the retention.\nI went a bit mad on the Write-Host commands in this script but, the staff who\u0026rsquo;d be running this are not all savvy with Powershell so thought more information was better.\nReviewing the VBO Logs You can download the logs using the Veeam Console.\nOpen the Console. Click the Hamburger Menu in the top left. Select Help and Support. Select Support Information. With Collect Logs selected, Click next. Select the proxy server your job is running via. Save the logs to a good location and extract them. The script below doesn\u0026rsquo;t perform many complex actions; it simply removes some square brackets and creates separate date and time variables in their own columns. However, it simplifies the process, making it easier to continue searching, formatting, and exporting the logs from PowerShell.\nSome of the logs can be over 100,000 lines so there is a progress bar written into the foreach loop for some visual feedback.\nParsing Job Warnings and Errors It\u0026rsquo;s quite useful to be able to pull out any warnings or errors from the previous jobs. Below is a script that can help do that.\nThe starttime is optional, if you do not provide it, it will provide the most recent job matching the name you provide. Make sure to enter the starttime as a string like the example shows.\nRemoving a User\u0026rsquo;s License This process can be a bit of a pig, there is a Veeam Blog or KB post here.\nBest Practices Guide If you are looking for what Veeam suggest about how to setup and use this solution, there\u0026rsquo;s a guide here for version 7.\nJET Database Errors This will not be an issue once upgraded to version 8 as they have swapped over to Postgresql instead of JET.\nError Example Example error, 21/03/2024 20:28:39 :: Failed to process site: https://domain.sharepoint.com/sites/sitename. Unable to access repository (E:\\*VBOCacheName*\\PersistentCache\\repository.adb) JetError -1504, JET_errNullInvalid, Null not valid :: 0:03:27.\nSolution Raise a ticket with Veeam first—they’ll guide you in using eseutil.exe (a Microsoft tool for troubleshooting Exchange databases) to check database integrity.\nSteps we followed:\nRan an integrity check and repair. Deleted all cache files except the database, allowing Veeam to recreate them. Attempted another repair. Finally, we deleted the cache database and performed a re-sync. Since our database was only 80GB, this was completed within hours. They did warn me that this proess could take days if the .adb file is larger.\nI quote Veeam here, JET errors are notoriously hard to fix without a cache re-sync. They’re typically caused by a forcefully terminated open thread to the database, such as a server reboot.\nWarning: Possible team chat sync problem was detected An odd issue quickly fixed by Veeam Support: a mailbox tied to a Microsoft 365 group refused to back up, running for days without completing.\nVeeam advised against terminating jobs that are running outside the job Window and to allow atleast 2 retries for a job to minimise issues with throttling and JET based errors, see here for JET Errors.\nLog File snippet you should find 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [05.08.2024 05:24:55.909] 68 (8380) Changed items: 0, deleted items: 0, read state changes: 100 [05.08.2024 05:24:55.909] 68 (8380) Warning: Possible team chat sync problem was detected [05.08.2024 05:24:55.914] 47 (5180) Processing mailbox: groupmailboxup@groups.domain.com...

Navigate to %ProgramData\\Veeam\\Backup365.
